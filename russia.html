        Russia, a country that stretches over a vast expanse of eastern Europe
        and northern Asia. Once the preeminent republic of the Union of Soviet
        Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.; commonly known as the Soviet Union),
        Russia became an independent country after the dissolution of the Soviet
        Union in December 1991.
      </p>

      <p>
        Russia is a land of superlatives. By far the world’s largest country, it
        covers nearly twice the territory of Canada, the second largest. It
        extends across the whole of northern Asia and the eastern third of
        Europe, spanning 11 time zones and incorporating a great range of
        environments and landforms, from deserts to semiarid steppes to deep
        forests and Arctic tundra. Russia contains Europe’s longest river, the
        Volga, and its largest lake, Ladoga. Russia also is home to the world’s
        deepest lake, Baikal, and the country recorded the world’s lowest
        temperature outside the North and South poles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inhabitants of Russia are quite diverse. Most are ethnic Russians,
        but there also are more than 120 other ethnic groups present, speaking
        many languages and following disparate religious and cultural
        traditions. Most of the Russian population is concentrated in the
        European portion of the country, especially in the fertile region
        surrounding Moscow, the capital. Moscow and St. Petersburg (formerly
        Leningrad) are the two most important cultural and financial centers in
        Russia and are among the most picturesque cities in the world. Russians
        are also populous in Asia, however; beginning in the 17th century, and
        particularly pronounced throughout much of the 20th century, a steady
        flow of ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking people moved eastward into
        Siberia, where cities such as Vladivostok and Irkutsk now flourish.
